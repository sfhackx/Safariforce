## Safariforce

Universal Explorers is headed for adventure...virtually! Their researchers are out in the field taking pictures of the hundreds of wild animals they come across every minute to build up a portfolio for their clients. They want you to enable them to catalog the pictures by species and by geography without relying on human intervention (unless the picture is a little confusing).

### Requirements

- Public (unauthenticated) users can upload pictures (**Bonus**: Demonstrate this on a mobile device)
- The app automatically processes pictures and picks out plausible sightings of species of interest through machine intelligence
- Pictures are automatically tagged with statistically confirmed species sightings and their geotagged location (**Bonus**: Display sightings on a map)
- Experts (Salesforce users) are notified when ambiguous pictures are found and can then manually tag them

### Supported Learning

- Einstein Vision (see <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trails/get_smart_einstein/projects/predictive_vision_apex" target="_blank">related Trailhead project</a>!)
- Lightning Components
- Process Builder
